                            <p>     This project was split into two parts, one where we remixed designs in Tinkercad, and the other where we remixed designs in Fusion. While I have used Tinkercad before, this was my first experience with Autodesk Fusion. For my first remix, I wanted to design a playing card case in the shape of a heart. I drew the design on paper first to get a baseline idea of what I wanted my design to look like.</p>

It didn't end up failing, and the printer was able to finish without any supports.</p>

                            <p>     It was pretty easy to figure out how to use the software, especially since I had prior experience. However, when the first print was finished, the two parts of the case did not fit together. I went back to Tinkercad and saw that the sleeve and the heart were two different widths (in the z direction). Due to this inconsistency, the drawer was too tall to fit inside the heart shape, since the heart went through the sleeve in the design, making the sleeve slightly too short. To fix this, I copied the sleeve design and made it a hole instead of a solid, and placed it in the same space that the sleeve was originally, and combined the heart and the rectangular prism shaped hole into one shape. Then I put the solid sleeve back in place. Once again I sliced the design and sent it to the printer, and it was successful on the second try!</p>

                            <p>     After using Tinkercad, it was a bit of a shock diving straight into the deep end with Autodesk Fusion. I found the user interface to be much less intuitive than Tinkercad, and experienced my fair share of frustration with the software. The second design I wanted to create was a decorative lid for a mason jar. I drew my design on paper once more to start off the design process. Next, I found a design for a lid, as well as a design for a flower that I liked, and exported them into Fusion.</p>

                            <p>     Once I was familiar with the general functionality of Fusion, it was fine for copying the flower design many times, and scaling them to be different sizes with different orientations. When I was happy with the layout, I sliced the design and printed it. I decided to try using supports this time, to make sure that the top of the lid was able to hold the flowers.</p>

                            <p>     The first print of my lid was thwarted by a lack of filament, as the printer ran out halfway through, and was just printing air. I had to reload a new roll of filament into the printer, and try again. The second iteration went perfectly, and I was able to see how the supports attached and practice detaching them from my print.</p>

                            <p>     In addition to my challenges with filament running out, and parts not quite fitting together, I also noticed some stringy bits on the undersides of the card sleeve. This was likely because the printer was having to print over air to make the roof of the design, and it was unsupported. This is part of the reason why I opted to include supports in my slicing of the lid in PrusaSlicer. This print had no such issues as a result! Overall, both of my prints were eventually successful, but could definitely be modified further to optimize the designs. For instance, adding fill in the parts of the sleeve and drawer that are in the heart shape (everywhere except the rectangle where cards would go). Hopefully this would reduce the stringy aspects of this design. I could also try printing it on the side of the heart, but I would definitely be nervous about it falling over during printing, and would need supports. The lid design could be scaled up or down to fit different size jars and bottles in the future as well.</p>
