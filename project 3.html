                            <p>     Before beginning the assembly process, we read through an instruction manual for the kit. I really liked the manual, since it was very easy to read and navigate, and included extensive pictures which showed different angles and close up shots of different parts of the kit as it was being assembled. This allowed me to compare what I was doing and verify that it was correct. One change I would make would be to include an image of each component next to its listing in the table on pages 1 and 2. This would make it easier to identify the resistors, and would just be a good reference for looking at the finished product, as well as for future reference in other projects. Without a visual representation of the components, the component listing table loses some of its value. </p>

                            <p>    While actually assembling the kits, my lab partner and I each worked in parallel on our own robots, asking for help and comparing methods when we got stuck. This method for dividing the work was efficient, and at the end we had two working robots to fine-tune. I had prior soldering experience from PHYS 39 (advanced lab), as well as independent projects, so this part was smooth sailing for me, as well as an opportunity to help my partner to get the hang of it. The instruction manual made it even easier with the close up images of each step of the kit’s assembly.</p>

                            <p>     The most challenging part of assembly was fine-tuning the potentiometers. This took a lot of patience, and trial and error, to find a good placement for each side. By starting with big changes and seeing how the behavior changed, and then small changes once I had a general idea what turning each potentiometer in each direction would do, I eventually found a good balance, and the robot was able to complete the track on the desk, on the classroom floor, and the hallway floor! I definitely noticed the lights not being super bright, and the speed being lazy, and this ended up just being solved by changing the batteries out for fresh ones.</p>

                            <p>     The next step of this project was to 3D print a chassis enclosure for our robot. To do this, we used digital calipers to take measurements of each of the two robots, and create a 2D model of the base plate in Fusion. We each took measurements for one of the robots, wrote them down on paper, and compared our answers to make sure the measurements were reasonable before implementing them in CAD. We started by making a box with these parameters, and later figured out how to punch holes in the box for access to components by modifying the 2D drawing and extruding up and out.</p>

                            <p>     The first print was slightly too small to fit our robot, as we hadn’t anticipated the need to measure the distance between the capacitors before break, and we had estimated (apparently incorrectly). Once we measured the actual distance and changed the CAD design to reflect this change, it was a perfect fit! We were even able to pick up the root by the chassis without it falling out.</p>

                            <p>     When brainstorming ideas for our enclosures, we thought about trying to make our robots look like cars. Our initial idea was to make one robot look like a DeLorean DMC-12 from Back to the Future, and the other robot look like a VW Beetle. This was a bit ambitious, and we only ended up having the time to bring one of these designs to life. I ended up browsing several websites looking for a VW Beetle 3D print design before finally deciding on a modern design that I found through thangs.com. I imported the design into the collaborative Fusion space that my partner created, and we worked together to combine our initial box design with this new, complex shell. We essentially ended up cutting the shape of our initial design out of the inside of the beetle design, since we knew our initial design would fit. In order to allow access to the batteries and power button, we took out the side and back windows of the beetle. The lights were easy to make holes for, as we just extruded out from the initial design as we had done previously, and created little windows for the LEDs to be visible. The sensors were able to see the ground still, as we did not have any components of the shell underneath the robot, it was only a cap on top, and the wheels were able to move due to round cutouts we made on the interior of the beetle shell.</p>
