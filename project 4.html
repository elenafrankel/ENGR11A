                            <p>     The objective of project 4 was to build a prosthetic hand from parts we 3D printed from an open source design from e-NABLE. To begin, we registered for accounts on the e-NABLE hub to get access to the STL files for the Phoenix Hand V2, and read through the instruction manual provided: https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/dd/6b/45/30/fc/Phoenix_v2_assembly_guide.pdf </p>
                            <p> We also found videos on youtube demonstrating the assembly process in detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXoVSTgzyec </p>
                            <p> Since I had been sick and absent the week prior to assembly, and my lab partner was unable to start printing that week because all the printers were occupied, we started the week by arranging the STL files in the slicer and starting the prints. The prints took anywhere from 4-12 hours to complete, so we spent our class time reviewing the instruction manuals from e-NABLE and the NIH 3D print exchange, watching assembly videos, and brainstorming ideas for beneficial modifications to the Phoenix Hand.</p>

                            <p>    The instruction manual from e-NABLE was very good in many ways, but I would definitely make some changes if it were up to me. I especially liked the specific images to help identify the different types of pins. On the other hand, the cutout patterns were somewhat unnecessary in my opinion, as you can just hold the foam to the part and trace the outline of as much padding as needed. This method was especially helpful since we did not have to print out the instruction manual, and we did not have to figure out how to scale the pattern up to 150% (the scale we printed our parts at). In addition, I found the text to be confusing, and the images unclear for the process of stringing the hand. The wording was convoluted, using terms like: “Pass the thread from the ring finger through hole 3 on the whippletree and back out through hole 4” and “the fourth hole from the thumb side” without providing a diagram with labeled holes of the hand. </p>

It would have been helpful to have bookmarks in the video showing where each step of the assembly was demonstrated, but by just watching it all the way through I got a fairly complete understanding of the process. </p>

                            <p>     Once we had completed prints, we began the assembly process. The first step was to remove the supports from the parts of the hand, which took much longer than we would have liked. This especially became an issue when we tried to remove the supports from the paths inside the palm where the strings were supposed to run through. These supports simply would not cleanly come out, and we didn’t have the time to reprint this part without supports. Thankfully, we were able to crowdsource a new part from another group who had an extra on hand! </p>

                            <p>     Following the assembly instructions, we put together the fingers, attached them to the hand, and placed the rubber bands on the joints to make the hand stay open by default. Then, with help from the TA, we thermal formed the part which wraps around the user’s forearm, since it is easier to print a flat surface than a curved one. This also made the cuff stronger! We attached the cuff to the hand, and then moved onto the most challenging part of the assembly (in my opinion).</p>

                            <p>     Stringing the fingers and hand took patience, precision, and critical thinking to decipher the instructions. It took a couple of tries to get the strings at the correct length and tension before securing the ends to the fingertips and the cuff. To make sure the knots did not come undone, we triple knotted and superglued them before placing the gel fingertips on top. The last steps were to cut and place the foam on the inside of the hand for the comfort of the wearer, place the wrist straps, and attach the bar across the palm for a wearer with fingers to grip. In the end, even with a slow start, we had a working prosthetic hand! This was a super cool process to go through, and an amazing open source resource to have available.  </p>

                            <p>    We did the last step of project 4 before we even started assembling the Phoenix hand due to our timing of starting prints. This was to find a new function for the hand and design a first pass idea for how to implement this improvement to the design. Our idea was to install a functionality in the fingertips of the hand where magnets would allow for the easy installation and removal of various tools. We used Fusion 360 to combine one of the finger STL files with a file we found on thangs.com for an interchangeable flat head/phillips head screwdriver. We only used the base of the screwdriver to make a hole in the shape of an octagonal prism in the fingertip so that we could print the design, superglue a magnet in the hole, and be able to put a screwdriver tip or another type of useful tool in the tip of the user’s prosthetic finger. This would allow for new functionality of the Phoenix hand, but also be easily removable for the user to choose whether or not to have it attached at any given time. </p>

                            <p>     Overall, this project opened my eyes to the sheer quantity of resources available on the internet to 3D print prosthetics for different purposes. As someone without a physical disability, I hadn’t thought about the idea of being able to 3D print something like this at home or at a university/library. It’s a wonderful concept, but could definitely still be improved. I noticed that on the e-NABLE website they have categories of different prosthetics and the situations in which they would or would not be able to be used. They have many options for people without fingers, hands, or wrists; however, none for people with disabilities that extend past the elbow. So while the e-NABLE organization is doing important work, there is always more innovation to cultivate in the process of making the world accessible to all. </p>

                            <p>     Additionally, there are still many factors that must align in order for a person to have access to this technology. The term open source assumes the user owns or has access to a computer, slicing software, a 3D printer, and the additional components that come in the kit/funds to purchase a kit. It also assumes proficiency in technology relating to 3D printing and assembly, and the physical abilities to read the instructions and assemble the parts into a usable prosthetic. In the text What Can a Body Do, this discussion of  how “Disability in part results when the shape of the world—buildings and streets but also institutions, cultural organizations, centers of power—operates rigidly, with a brittle and scripted sense of what a body does or does not do, how it moves and organizes its world” (Hendren), exemplifies the sheer quantity of work that needs to be done to create universal accessibility when the world has been built in a way that caters to certain groups of people and ignores the needs of others. I love the work that e-NABLE is doing, and hope to see them continue to expand their collection of designs and bring accessibility to more groups of people.</p>
